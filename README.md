# RepoRadar
RepoRadar is a 100% compose-based Android app that displays a list of the 100 most
starred Github repositories.

## Software Requirements
- [x] Maximum of three hours of development time.
- [ ] Use the GitHub REST API to display a list of the 100 most
  starred Github repositories using `GET https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=stars:>0`.
- [ ] For each of the repositories, also display its top contributor.
- [ ] To get the list of contributors for a given repository, use: `GET https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/contributors`
- [ ] Use the provided OAuth2 token to avoid Githubâ€™s API rate limiting, but do not publish it.
- [ ] Write your code in Kotlin, Java, or both.
- [ ] Add any instructions in a README.
- [ ] Handle any unique constraints and to-be-expected
  circumstances on a mobile device.

## Getting Started
To get started create the `apikeys.properties` at root level of the project and enter the value for `github.token=`
