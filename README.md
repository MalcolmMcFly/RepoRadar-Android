starred Github repositories.

## Software Requirements
- [x] Maximum of three hours of development time.
- [x] Use the GitHub REST API to display a list of the 100 most
  starred Github repositories using `GET https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=stars:>0`.
- [x] For each of the repositories, also display its top contributor.
- [x] To get the list of contributors for a given repository, use: `GET https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/contributors`
- [x] Use the provided OAuth2 token to avoid Githubâ€™s API rate limiting, but do not publish it.
- [x] Write your code in Kotlin, Java, or both.
- [x] Add any instructions in a README.
- [x] Handle any unique constraints and to-be-expected
  circumstances on a mobile device.

## Getting Started
To get started create the `apikeys.properties` at root level of the project and enter the value for `github.token=`  
Please note, the token in the project instructions don't work, you'll have to create your own in the Github Developer Settings.
